# Ota

From the Swahili word for 'grow' or 'daydream'.

This is intended to be a micro-blogging or wiki style framework where you
are given a lot of freedom to produce content using some very basic
primitives and simple procedures.

Goals:

 1. Self contained and easy to deploy.
 2. All changes are committed to local directory.
 3. Simple web server.
 4. Basic authentication system.
 5. Very little structure.
